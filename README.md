# PitBullsNews
US news relating to pit bulls

This project is a graduate student project at the MIT Media Lab. We are examining how public discourse about pit bulls (Pitbulls, American Staffordshire Terriers, American Bullys, etc.) has changed over time. 

To do so, we are evaluating (1) how people on Reddit are changing how they talk about pitbull breeds over time, (2) how news reports about pitbulls have changed in frequency or topic over time, and (3) how Google searches about pitbulls have changed over time.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
